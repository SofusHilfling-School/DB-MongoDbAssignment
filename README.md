## Assignment questions
### What is sharding in mongoDB?
Sharding a database is basically horizontal scaling of the given database. It is more specifically a method for distributing or partitioning data across multiple machines.

It is useful when no single machine can handle large modern-day workloads, by allowing you to scale horizontally.

Horizontal scaling, also known as scaling-out, refers to adding machines to share the data set and load. Horizontal scaling allows for near-limitless scaling to handle big data and intense workloads.
